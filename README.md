# Market analysis to introduce a new beer

## Abstract

We are a beer company eager to launch a new product. We have therefore hired data analysis in order to look at beer reviews to find the customer needs and succeed in our market entry. For this, we will first observe the global beer landscape to see how satisfied the customers are with the current market to find if an entry is possible. In this case, we will observe the favorable charasteritcs of the products in order to multiply the chances of a succesfull market entry. We will also analysize the sales of other breweries through [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurnapa/brewery-operations-and-market-analysis-dataset) dataset.

## Quickstart

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11 or ...
conda activate <env_name>


# install requirements
pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```



### How to use the library
