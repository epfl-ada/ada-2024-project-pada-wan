# Market analysis to introduce a new beer

## Abstract

We are a group of students passionate about brewering eager to launch our own beer. We have therefore taken it uppon our selves to look at beer reviews, find the customer needs and succeed in our market entry. For this, we will first observe the global beer landscape to see how satisfied the customers are with the current market and to see if an entry is possible. In this case, we will analyse the favorable characteristics of the products in order to multiply our chances of a succesfull market entry. We will also make an in depth analysis of the sales from other breweries through [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurnapa/brewery-operations-and-market-analysis-dataset) dataset. Once we have our product, we will develop a launch strategy containing A DAta-driven communication plan and launch schedule. 

## Quickstart

```bash
# clone project
git clone <project link>
cd <project repo>

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11 or ...
conda activate <env_name>


# install requirements
pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```



### How to use the library
Tell us how the code is arranged, any explanations goes here.



## Project Structure

The directory structure of new project looks like this:

```
├── data                        <- Project data files
│
├── src                         <- Source code
